6. Model Outputs and Explanations
Naive Bayes Model:
•	The Naive Bayes model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.
•	It provides a precision of X%, recall of X%, and an F1-score of X%.
•	The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Explanation: Naive Bayes models the probability of a message being spam or non-spam based on the frequency of words in the message. It assumes that features are independent, which may not hold true in practice but often works well in practice for text classification tasks.
Neural Networks with Custom Embeddings:
•	The neural network model with custom embeddings achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.
•	It provides a precision of X%, recall of X%, and an F1-score of X%.
•	The model architecture includes embedding layers, LSTM layers, dropout regularization, and dense layers with ReLU activation.
Explanation: This model learns dense representations of words through embeddings and captures sequential dependencies in the text using LSTM layers. It offers flexibility in modeling complex relationships in the data but requires more computational resources compared to traditional methods like Naive Bayes.
Bidirectional LSTM Model:
•	The bidirectional LSTM model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.
•	It provides a precision of X%, recall of X%, and an F1-score of X%.
•	Bidirectional LSTM layers process the input sequence in both forward and backward directions, capturing contextual information effectively.
Explanation: Bidirectional LSTM enhances the ability to capture long-term dependencies in text data by processing sequences in both directions. It often performs well on tasks involving sequential data but may require more training data and computational resources.
•	Transfer Learning with Universal Sentence Encoder:
•	The model with Transfer Learning using Universal Sentence Encoder achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.
•	It provides a precision of X%, recall of X%, and an F1-score of X%.
•	The Universal Sentence Encoder provides pre-trained embeddings for text, capturing semantic meaning effectively.
Explanation: Transfer learning with Universal Sentence Encoder leverages pre-trained models to extract dense representations of text, enabling effective classification even with limited training data. It offers a powerful approach for text classification tasks, especially when dealing with domain-specific or limited datasets.
7. Model Comparison
